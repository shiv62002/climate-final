Behind the Scenes
This project was a collaborative effort between Arnav, Shiv, and Jerome. Our goal was to interactive showcase the economic impacts of changes in temperature over time both globaly for the whole world and by each individual country. We started off by collecting and cleaning 20 years of economic and climate datasets. The hardest part was trying to decide how we want to implement interactive D3.js maps and charts for global and country-level insights. In order to maintain an interactive site, we made it a point to enable users to have access to a wide range of datasets (as seen .  So we wanted to design responsive controls such as dropdowns, sliders, animations and polished tooltips/legends to keep our viewers hooked. Another challenge that we faced was portraying datasets and showing the correlation between them. With economic changes, there are many factors that can influence how well an economy is doing. In order to correlate our two ideas, we found specific datasets which not only showcase the economic timetable of every country but also the data such as wheat yield and damage from natural disasters. With this information we decided to showcase the data and allow the readers to derive their own meanings from this but we also attempted to showcase the correlation (if possible) between the data presented. 

To run our site:
When you open the main page, you’ll see an interactive world heat map. Use the dropdown menu to choose the data variable (GDP, wheat yield, temperature anomaly, food-price inflation, or disaster damages) and the year slider to scrub through 2000–2022. Scrolling through the years lets you watch how each country’s value evolves over time.

When you click on a country in the front-page map, you’ll be taken to another page for that specific nation. On that page, you will see interactive line charts that display the full 2000–2022 trend for 2 of the variables (GDP growth, wheat yield, temperature anomaly, food-price inflation, and disaster damages) letting you hover over points for exact values and compare patterns over time. In the same light, you can interactively visualize datasets which compare global climate trends to economic factors globally for the whole world using the global link at the top of the page.
